            <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
            <p><strong>Primary: Madeline, Secondary: </strong></p>
            <p>Vehicle detection and classification are crucial for traffic control, management, and surveillance, but manual monitoring of traffic footage is inefficient, considering the volume of vehicles in high-traffic areas. Automated vehicle classification systems can address this problem by using machine learning algorithms to detect and categorize vehicles in real-time.</p>

            <h3>✅ Literature Review</h3>
            <p>Automated vehicle classification systems remain difficult to implement, considering issues such as the computational constraints of video processing, the effect of poor weather and environmental conditions, and occlusion [1]. Researchers have focused on improving vehicle detection using machine learning classifiers and deep learning methods, such as CNN-based methods, YOLO, and Vision Transformer (ViT) techniques [1], [2], [3].</p>

            <h3>✅ Dataset Description</h3>
            <p>We plan to use the Stanford Cars dataset for training our models. The dataset contains 16,185 images across 196 different classes of cars, with annotations for each class describing the make, model, and year of the car.</p>
